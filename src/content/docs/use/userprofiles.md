### How User Profiles Work

User Profiles on dAcademy query [The Graph](/stack/thegraph) and retrieve your specific completions in dAcademy.  You can view your profile while connected via your wallet, or by https://dacade.my/#/user/ [insert any Optimism wallet address or ENSname.eth]

Profiles are compiled automatically from queries and you do not need to do anything to create one.

### Troubleshooting Your Profile

If you aren't seeing content in your profile possibly:

- Your wallet is not connected via [Optimism](/stack/optimism)

- You haven't [submitted](/use/submissions) any proofs of completion or earned any [NFTs](/stack/soulboundnfts)
