### How Submissions work under-the-hood

[IPFS](stack/ipfs)

[Contracts](stack/smartcontracts)

[UCAN delegations via Storacha](/stack/ucan) for image submissions.

### Tracking Your Submissions

When you submit a proof of completion for a chapter, you will receive a toast notification ...

In the table of contents of a playbook you will notice color changes on completed chapters.  If on desktop you will also see a tooltip informing you it has been completed.

In your [user profile](/use/userprofiles) you can see all of your submissions: pending, accepted, rejected.

**Pending** means your submission was successful but is has not been reviewed by the author/owner of the playbook.

**Accepted** means your submission has been accepted as valid by the author/owner of the playbook.

**Rejected** means your submission did not meet the requirements of the author/owner of the playbook.
