dAcademy originated in MetaGame.  After many raids on developing playbooks for a MetaLibrary, members of MetaFam and MetaGame created [Quest Chains](/stack/questchains).

Quest Chains intended to serve both the [Quests in MetaGame](https://github.com/MetaFam/TheGame/tree/master/packages/web/components/Quest) and to populate the [Academy (MetaLibrary)](https://github.com/MetaFam/TheGame/blob/master/packages/web/pages/academy/index.tsx).

dAcademy is the next evolution of these builds and has become a standalone project.

### The Now

dAcademy stands for Decentralized Academy.
